Collaborative filtering model using Apache Spark with Java

Simple Collaboritive Filtering Model created for Big Data class in final year of computer science degree. The goal of this project was to do a useful analysis of a large amount of data quickly. Using apache spark for parallel execution across 5 different machines, the code runs very efficiently with the 5.67 GB dataset. 

Note: This was a small school project that I worked on alone, code is not very well doccumented 


See Jack Jakober CS435 Project for full write up and in-depth explaination of the algorithm.
